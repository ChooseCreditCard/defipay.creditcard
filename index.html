      <h2>What Is a DeFi-Linked Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A DeFi-linked credit card looks like a normal consumer card, but the funding source is a DeFi position instead of a conventional bank account. Your collateral, stablecoins or liquidity-pool tokens sit in smart contracts while the card provider handles fiat settlement on traditional payment rails.</p>
      <p>From the merchant’s point of view it is still a standard card transaction. The DeFi layer lives behind the scenes, where assets are borrowed, swapped or withdrawn from pools and translated into the currency required to settle with the card network.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How a DefiPay Transaction Flows End to End</h2>
      <p>When you present your card, the terminal sends an authorization request just like any other payment. The issuer’s platform checks your linked DeFi position, determines how much value can be drawn against it and decides whether to approve the transaction.</p>
      <p>If the payment is approved, smart contracts and off-chain systems work together: assets may be swapped into a stablecoin, temporarily borrowed using an overcollateralized loan, and then converted to fiat so that the card network can settle with the merchant acquirer.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Spreads and Protocol Costs</h2>
      <p>DeFi-powered cards combine traditional payment fees with protocol-level costs. On-chain trades, borrowing and rebalancing can generate gas fees, pool withdrawal fees and slippage, on top of any card or FX charges that would apply anyway.</p>
      <p>Issuers might also layer service fees on DeFi interactions, such as a percentage charge for unlocking liquidity or a markup on on-chain swap prices. Reviewing both the card fee schedule and the DeFi fee model is essential before using this setup for day-to-day spending.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards, Yield and Token Incentives</h2>
      <p>Some DeFi cards market “spend your yield, not your principal” by directing staking or liquidity rewards toward card payments. Others offer boosted rewards if you hold or stake a platform token in addition to your base position.</p>
      <p>The headline APR can look attractive, but users need to weigh it against market risk, smart-contract risk and any lockup requirements. Real-world value depends on whether net rewards remain positive after volatility, protocol fees and card fees are factored in.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Smart Contracts and Regulatory Questions</h2>
      <p>DeFi-linked cards add extra layers of technical and legal uncertainty. Users are exposed to smart-contract vulnerabilities, governance changes in underlying protocols and potential shifts in how regulators treat DeFi-based collateral and yield.</p>
      <p>On top of that, converting crypto assets to fiat through DeFi pathways may have tax implications that vary by jurisdiction. Clear statements, exportable histories and transparent disclosure of which protocols are in use are important for anyone considering this kind of product.</p>
